Description: PyMovie
        =======
        
        PyMovie is a simple (hopefully) application for extracting lightcurves from occultation videos.
        
        It is specially designed to be robust in both star tracking and data extraction when the
        video has been disturbed by wind-shake.
        
        The name was chosen out of respect and deference to LiMovie, a pioneer application
        published many years ago.
        This application has fewer 'bells and whistles' than LiMovie and so should be easier
        to use for a newbie.
